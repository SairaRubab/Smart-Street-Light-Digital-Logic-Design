# Smart-Street-Light-Digital-Logic-Design
An Intelligent Street Lighting System using Arduino that dynamically adjusts brightness based on motion detection. The system keeps streetlights dim when idle and brightens upon detecting pedestrians, cyclists, or vehicles. It also activates the next two lights ahead for seamless illumination and energy efficiency.
